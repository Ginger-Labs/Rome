# cocoapods-rome

Rome makes it easy to build a list of frameworks. We have heavily modified this README and the tool to suit our own purposes. For orignal documentation see https://github.com/CocoaPods/Rome

## Installation

Use the following process to build and install this gem.

```bash
$ bundle install
$ gem build cocoapods-rome.gemspec
$ sudo gem install cocoapods-rome-1.1.0.gem
```

Steps for building binary pods and incorporating them into the app are in the Notability repo.
